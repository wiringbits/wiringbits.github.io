While wiringbits has been around unoficcially for years, it has been formally there since Jan/2019.

It's incredible how a team that works building different websites needs more than a year to build it's own website, could it be due to not consider it important as we have been full of work since the beggining, or just because we still don't have a logo, in any case, sometimes it's better to have something than to wait for perfection.

Hopefully, we'll be writing a post per month.
