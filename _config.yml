    description: Alexis played a pivotal role in the successful migration of our web3 application, which led to substantial cost savings and a simplification of our overall infrastructure. Throughout the project, Alexis demonstrated exceptional responsiveness and clear communication, ensuring that the project status and timelines were always transparent and easily understandable. His extensive experience proved invaluable as it enabled us to address a variety of issues related to blockchain integrations across multiple vendors. Alexis consistently proposed solutions that were both practical and innovative, illustrating his commitment to our project's success above his own billable hours. I highly recommend Alexis and look forward to working with him again in the future.

    description: Alexis was invaluable to our project, but, more crucially, he was willing to go the extra mile with everything we needed help with. His ability to quickly understand our project's needs and then execute helped us rescue an important blockchain project for our client, and we couldn't have done it without his help and great attitude.

    description: Alexis is a true lifesaver! After my web developer left our project, I hired a new developer who turned out to be a disaster and ended up deleting our site from the server. Although we permanently lost our user data, I fortunately found Alexis, who was able to restore our website from the repository on GitLab in a matter of a few hours. And because I told Alexis that it was urgent, he was able to do it on the weekend no less. I’ve continued to work with Alexis since then, as I find him to be very straightforward and honest in his communications with me.
