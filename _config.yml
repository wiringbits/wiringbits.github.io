    position: Non-profit webapp founder
    description: Alexis is a true lifesaver! After my web developer left our project, I hired a new developer who turned out to be a disaster and ended up deleting our site from the server. Although we permanently lost our user data, I fortunately found Alexis, who was able to restore our website from the repository on GitLab in a matter of a few hours. And because I told Alexis that it was urgent, he was able to do it on the weekend no less. Iâ€™ve continued to work with Alexis since then, as I find him to be very straightforward and honest in his communications with me.
