Alexis played a pivotal role in the successful migration of our web3 application, which led to substantial cost savings and a simplification of our overall infrastructure.

Throughout the project, Alexis demonstrated exceptional responsiveness and clear communication, ensuring that the project status and timelines were always transparent and easily understandable.

His extensive experience proved invaluable as it enabled us to address a variety of issues related to blockchain integrations across multiple vendors.

Alexis consistently proposed solutions that were both practical and innovative, illustrating his commitment to our project's success above his own billable hours.

I highly recommend Alexis and look forward to working with him again in the future.
