# Company
While wiringbits is a company based in Culiacan, Mexico, there is no office, everyone works remotely.

We strive for great quality on the software we built, and try to open source everything we can.

## Projects
We have experience in several areas, while we specialize in the Web Applications and Blockchain, we have produced browser extensions and even GitHub apps.

These are some of the projects:
- [The Stakenet Block Explorer](https://xsnexplorer.io/)
- [The Stakenet Orderbook](https://orderbook.stakenet.io/)
- [Pull Request Attention](https://prattention.com)

- [Crypto Coin Alerts](https://github.com/AlexITC/crypto-coin-alerts)
