Have you ever seen an error like this when loading `sbt`? this short post explains a way to deal with it:

```
[info] Loading global plugins from /home/dell/.sbt/1.0/plugins
[info] Loading settings for project sample-api-build from plugins.sbt ...
[info] Loading project definition from /home/dell/projects/sample/sample-api/project
[warn] There may be incompatibilities among your library dependencies; run 'evicted' to see detailed eviction warnings.
[error] java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: sbt/Def$.ifS(Lsbt/internal/util/Init$Initialize;Lsbt/internal/util/Init$Initialize;Lsbt/internal/util/Init$Initialize;)Lsbt/internal/util/Init$Initialize; (loaded from file:/home/dell/.sbt/boot/scala-2.12.10/org.scala-sbt/sbt/1.3.10/main-settings_2.12-1.3.10.jar by java.net.URLClassLoader@ad9e5a72) called from class wartremover.WartRemover$ (loaded from file:/home/dell/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/wartremover/sbt-wartremover_2.12_1.0/2.4.17/sbt-wartremover-2.4.17.jar by sbt.internal.PluginManagement$PluginClassLoader@853e7c98).

```


## What we know

These are the known details:

1. There seems to be a binary-incompatibility problem with our project dependencies ([ref](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/binary-compatibility-for-library-authors.html)).
2. The error message suggests you to run `sbt evicted` which is impossible because sbt refuses to load.
3. The error mentions `sbt-wartremover`, hence, the problem is about the sbt plugings, removing the plugin will likely get rid of the problem.


## How to approach this

While this is likely well-known to people very familiar with sbt, it wasn't for me:

1. Let's update `project/plugins.sbt` to include this line `enablePlugins(SbtPlugin)`
2. Go to the `project` directory and run `sbt evicted`

Now, you get the dependency issues diplayed, like:

```

```

Apparently, there is no binary-incompatibility between the dependencies.

The problem was introduced when adding the `sbt-wartremover` plugin but nothing related shows up in the evicted dependencies.

In my case, it turned out that the `sbt-wartremover` plugin I depended on required a newer sbt version while my project had sbt 1.3.


## Conclusion
Long time ago, I experienced a similar problem which involved binary-incompatibility and I had to ask the community for help, after some years, I got into this again which motivated me write about this.

This is one non-obvious issue which can be very confusing unless you have been in Scala for a while.
