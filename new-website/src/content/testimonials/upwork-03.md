Alexis has surprised me: I had a very positive experience with Alexis.

Generally, I really have to point developers exactly where they need to be looking to fix issues or add features.

Alexis very quickly grasped the relevant parts of our large code base on his own.

I usually have to spell out exactly what my expectations are, how the code should be structured, what's the minimum bar for quality, etc.

Alexis went above and beyond my expectations.

He brought considerations to the table, and only started work once we were on the same page.

It was such a pleasure to work with him.

It's obvious to me why he was one of the handful of folks to apply to a fixed-cost project: he stands behind his work.
