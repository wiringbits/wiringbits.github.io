Cesar from Wiringbits took over the Atala PRISM Browser Wallet development, a key tool that sits on top our Atala PRISM SDK, improving its quality and user experience considerably.

Cesar also created our Credentials Verification Portal which will be come a core tool for the PRISM ecosystem.

Cesar delivered quality code on time and also provided advice on new features and functionality that would provide value to end-users.

I would be happy to recommend Wiringbits as a company to work with.
