I am a backend developer and I am creating an ed-tech platform as a side-gig.

I asked Alexis if he could do the front end. I had previously asked someone else to do it and he and his team did a terrible job.

Alexis introduced me to the front end dev Saul from Wiringbits. I cannot praise them enough. They literally rescued the project - Saul has an attention for detail, cares about project and delivers a clean and quality solution.

He discusses the requirements with me every evening and every morning I look forward to waking up to a daily update.

Alexis is happy to jump on a call whenever I need to have a chat.

He is a very calming and reassuring influence. I am so pleased that I found them and I know I have found a team I can work with going into the future.

I wouldn't hesitate using Wiringbits again.
